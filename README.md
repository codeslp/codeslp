I am a data analytics engineer based in Tulsa, OK.

- ⚒️ I love data modeling. I enjoy interviewing stakeholders about business processes and then designing models that match those processes and grant vision into their processes. This also applies to creating new reports and views. What is stopping you from making better decisions today?
- 📦 I used AWS Textract, AWS Step Functions, and several Lambda functions to pull tables from PDFs to gain program-wide insights in a multi-year state-wide education initiative: https://github.com/codeslp/school_assessments_proj
- 📈 Here are reports and dashboards I've made in Tableau:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.farish

Other projects:
- 📺 I made local and web apis to allow analysts and data scientists to easily query a dataset that I normalized from a Netflix dataset. It includes a simple demo recommender to illustrate the functionality: 
- 📚 I cleaned and normalized a GoodReads books dataset and did some analysis on what metrics to use to rank them: https://github.com/codeslp/books_db
- 🎲 This is a dice rolling web API using flask, SQLalchemy, and SQLite (to store roll history):
