I am a data analytics engineer based in Tulsa, OK.

- ⚒️ I love data modeling. I love the process of interviewing stakeholders about business processes and discovering where they are stuck and then designing models that match those processes and grant vision into their processes. 
- 📦 I used AWS Textract, AWS Step Functions, and several Lambda functions to pull tables from PDFs: https://github.com/codeslp/school_assessments_proj
- 📈 Here are reports and dashboards I've made in Tableau:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.farish

Other projects:
- 📺 I made local and web apis to allow analysts and data scientists to easily query a dataset that I normalized from a Netflix dataset. It includes a simple demo recommender to illustrate the functionality: 
- 📚 I cleaned and normalized a GoodReads books dataset and did some analysis on what metrics to use to rank them: https://github.com/codeslp/books_db
- 🎲 This is a dice rolling web API using flask, SQLalchemy, and SQLite (to store roll history):
