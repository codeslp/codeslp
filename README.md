#### I am a data analytics engineer based in Tulsa, OK.

- ⚒️ I love data modeling. I enjoy interviewing stakeholders about business processes and designing models that can match processes as they stand presently and as they grow. What is stopping you from making better decisions today?

#### Projects:
- 📺 I made local and web apis to allow analysts and data scientists to easily query or make HTTP requests to a dataset that I normalized from a Netflix dataset. It includes a simple demo recommender to illustrate the functionality: https://github.com/codeslp/recommender_db
- 🧑‍🍳 I used AWS Textract, AWS Step Functions, Lambda functions, and Tableau to pull tables from PDFs to gain program-wide insights in a multi-year state-wide school nutrition training initiative: https://github.com/codeslp/school_assessments_proj
- 📈 Here are reports and dashboards I've made in Tableau:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.farish
- 📚 I cleaned and normalized a GoodReads books dataset and did some analysis on what metrics to use to rank them: https://github.com/codeslp/books_db
- 🎲 This is a dice rolling web API using flask, SQLalchemy, and SQLite (to store roll history):
